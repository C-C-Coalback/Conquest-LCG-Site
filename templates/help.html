  <h1>Debug commands</h1>
  <p>Below are a list of debug commands that can be used during the game.</p>
  <p>Commands are presented in the form of how they should be typed into the chat box in-game. If the command contains any "{}", you will need to replace this with what is indicated in the brackets. For example, a "{planet_pos}" indicates you need to replace this part with a planet number, i.e. 0, 1, 2, etc. Do not include any brackets in your command.</p>
  <p>There are two kinds of command: safe and unsafe.</p>
  <p>Safe commands require the game to be in a safe state, i.e. nothing is currently happening.</p>
  <p>Unsafe commands do not require the game to be in a safe state, but have a higher risk of breaking something irreparably.</p>
  <h3>Unsafe commands</h3>
  <p><b>/loaddeck/{deck_name}</b> - Loads a deck that you own with the given name. Once you have loaded a deck, this command does nothing. If your deck is not found, nothing will happen.</p>
  <p><b>/force-quit-action</b> - Forcefully quits action mode.</p>
  <p><b>/force-quit-reactions</b> - Forcefully quits all queued reactions.</p>
  <p><b>/force-quit-effects</b> - Forcefully quits all queued interrupts.</p>
  <p><b>/force-quit-damage</b> - Forcefully quits all queued instances of damage.</p>
  <p><b>/force-quit-moves</b> - Forcefully quits all queued moves.</p>
  <p><b>/debug-reactions</b> - Shows the currently queued reactions of each player.</p>
